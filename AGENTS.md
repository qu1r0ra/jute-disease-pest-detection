# AI Agent Directives

Welcome, AI Assistant! To keep the repository root clean, all AI model-specific context and instructions are located in the `docs/agents/` directory, while project architectural decisions are housed in `docs/`.

Before assisting with tasks, you **must** read and adhere to the guidelines provided in these documents:

1. **[CONTEXT.md](docs/agents/CONTEXT.md)**: The definitive guide to our tech stack, coding standards (`uv`, strict typing), and operational boundaries.
2. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**: A core overview of the project structure, deep learning (Lightning + Timm), and classical machine learning (Scikit-learn) implementations.

## Model-Specific Instructions

If you are a specific model, please also consult your tailored instruction file:

- **[CLAUDE.md](docs/agents/CLAUDE.md)**
- **[GEMINI.md](docs/agents/GEMINI.md)**
