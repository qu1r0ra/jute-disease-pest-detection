# # Deep Learning Model Selection and Training
#
# You may have noticed that the Deep Learning (DL) and the Classical Machine Learning (ML) workflows were separated into different notebooks. We deliberately separated them to allow for independent work. Specifically, I, CJ ([@qu1r0ra](https://github.com/qu1r0ra)) focused on DL while my friend Imman ([@Immern](https://github.com/Immern)) focused on Classical ML.
#
# You may have also noticed that each notebook has a corresponding `.py` script. This is to allow for better version control for `.ipynb` files, which are notoriously difficult to track with Git.
#
# That said, in this notebook, we will focus on training DL models experimentally. Specifically, we will do the ff.:
# - Conduct transfer learning on the ff. chosen Deep Learning architectures pretrained on _ImageNet-1K_ as baseline DL models:
#   - **EfficientNet-B5**
#   - **EfficientNet-B7** (not included initially but later added out of curiosity to compare with B5)
#   - **Inception v3**
#   - **MobileNet V2**
#   - **MobileViT (small)**
#   - **ResNet-50**
# - Decide on a baseline model to move forward with
# - Get checkpoints for different levels of fine-tuning on the chosen model:
#   - _Level 1_: ImageNet (pre-trained)
#   - _Level 2_: ImageNet (pre-trained) -> PlantVillage (fine-tuning)
#   - _Level 3_: ImageNet (pre-trained) -> PlantVillage (fine-tuning) -> PlantDoc (fine-tuning)
# - Conduct grid search on the chosen model with the ff. hyperparameters/settings:
#   - _Dropout rate_: 0.0, 0.1, 0.2
#   - _Checkpoints_: Levels 1, 2, 3
#
# **Note:**
#
# This notebook is expected to be executed in **Google Colab**, just as I did. You can click the 'Open in Colab' button above this cell. Specifically, I used Colab's L4 GPU.

# ## Fine-Tuning and Transfer Learning Setup
#
# We saw from EDA that our dataset is pretty small (2382 images across 6 classes) for an image recognition task. To address our limitation in data, we decided to employ fine tuning and transfer learning as key techniques for our DL experiments.
#
# First, what is the difference between fine-tuning and transfer learning? Both involve a pre-trained model, but fine-tuning trains part or all of the pre-trained model's layers whereas transfer learning only trains the final layer, freezing the rest (GeeksforGeeks, 2025).
#
# As a part of this experiment, we will employ the ff. 'levels' of fine-tuning and transfer learning:
# 1. **Level 1**: ImageNet (pre-trained) -> our Jute dataset (transfer learning)
# 2. **Level 2**: ImageNet (pre-trained) -> PlantVillage (fine-tuning) -> our Jute dataset (transfer learning)
# 3. **Level 3**: ImageNet (pre-trained) -> PlantVillage (fine-tuning) -> PlantDoc (fine-tuning) -> our Jute dataset (transfer learning)
#
# An intuition as to why this may work can be formed from the task of teaching a Tagalog-speaking Filipino the Spanish language. While we could just teach them Spanish directly, it may be more effective to first teach them Chavacano (a Spanish-based language spoken in the Philippines) before teaching them Spanish. Perhaps learning Chavacano first will make learning Spanish more effective, leading to a greater Spanish proficiency at the end.
#
# Thus, we hope that transfer learning will enable our deep learning models to adapt general patterns learned from ImageNet objects to the domain of leaf disease detection. We are also curious as to whether fine-tuning on related datasets such as PlantVillage and PlantDoc first before conducting transfer learning on our dataset will improve performance.
#
# Enough yapping, let's experiment!
# %% [markdown] id="3ba92b2d"
# ## Model Training
#
# Before we proceed with actual model training, it's always a good idea to perform a 'trial run' for each of our models. In our case, a trial run will consist of running a single train, validation, and test epoch just to make sure our models don't crash unexpectedly in the middle of training. It has happened to me several times in the past and I do not want to experience it again.
#
# Fortunately, PyTorch Lightning (a PyTorch wrapper) supports this with their `fast_dev_run` capability. This is what the script below will do.

# %% id="c99d0d78"
# !uv run python scripts/train_all_dl_check.py

# %% [markdown] id="a5624dad"
# Having verified that the fast dev run works, we can now conduct transfer learning on our chosen DL architectures pretrained on ImageNet-1K.
#
# Before running the script below, we highly recommend you to create a [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) (WandB) account to track the experiments. If you choose to log in to a WandB account, you will be prompted to enter an API key (see <https://docs.wandb.ai/models/quickstart>).

# %% id="d32c265a"
# !uv run python scripts/train_all_dl.py

# %% [markdown]
# At this point, we have finished training the DL baselines. If training went well, you should have obtained results similar to ours, which can be viewed in this run group: <https://wandb.ai/grade-descent/jute-disease-detection/groups/Baseline%20DL%20Models/workspace>.
#
# Looking at the validation F1 graph:
#
# ![Validation F1 Score Comparison: Baseline DL Models](../../assets/figures/dl/val_f1_baseline.png)
#
# For context, we used the ff. pre-trained models:
#
# | Architecture | Hugging Face Model Name | Parameters |
# | :--- | :--- | :--- |
# | EfficientNet-B7 | [tf_efficientnet_b7.ns_jft_in1k](https://huggingface.co/timm/tf_efficientnet_b7.ns_jft_in1k) | ~66.35M |
# | EfficientNet-B5 | [efficientnet_b5.sw_in12k_ft_in1k](https://huggingface.co/timm/efficientnet_b5.sw_in12k_ft_in1k) | ~30.39M |
# | ResNet-50 | [resnet50.a1_in1k](https://huggingface.co/timm/resnet50.a1_in1k) | ~25.56M |
# | Inception v3 | [inception_v3.tv_in1k](https://huggingface.co/timm/inception_v3.tv_in1k) | ~23.83M |
# | MobileViT (small) | [mobilevit_s.cvnets_in1k](https://huggingface.co/timm/mobilevit_s.cvnets_in1k) | ~5.58M |
# | MobileNet V2 | [mobilenetv2_100.ra_in1k](https://huggingface.co/timm/mobilenetv2_100.ra_in1k) | ~3.50M |
#
# Note that the Hugging Face models above may have been pre-trained in different environments and with different techniques. Still, we made sure all our models were eventually pre-trained on ImageNet, hence the `_in1k` suffixes.

# %% [markdown]
# Some insights:
# - **EfficientNet-B5** achieved the greatest top-1 validation F1. It has the second most parameters, so it is somewhat expected.
# - It is followed by **MobileNet V2**. Interestingly, MobileNetV2 achieved a performance comparable to EfficientNet-B5 despite having the least parameters. Hence, we decided to push through with MobileNet V2 for grid search. It is also more economical for us.
# - **MobileViT (small)** achieved the third-greatest top-1 validation F1. It has the second-least parameters.
# - Interestingly, **EfficientNet-B7** achieved the worst top-1 validation F1 despite having a similar architecture to MobileNet-B5, but with more than double its size (and thus, the most parameters).

# %% [markdown] id="b53753d7"
# That said, we can now proceed with obtaining our level 2 and level 3 checkpoints for our chosen DL architecture, **MobileNet V2**. These checkpoints will be used for the grid search. Let's first download the [PlantVillage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohitsingh1804/plantvillage) and [PlantDoc](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nirmalsankalana/plantdoc-dataset) datasets from Kaggle.

# %% id="4ccb68e2"
from jute_disease.data.download import download_plant_doc, download_plant_village

download_plant_village()
download_plant_doc()

# %% [markdown] id="b44de4eb"
# ### Level 2 Checkpoint
#
# `ImageNet (pre-trained) -> PlantVillage (fine-tuning)`
#
# For the fine-tuning stages, we will not freeze any parameters. Moreover, we will discard the classifier head and replace it with a new one with the number of neurons equal to the number of classes for the PlantVillage dataset (38).

# %% id="bc2b9c26"
# !uv run python src/jute_disease/engines/dl/pretrain.py \
#   --data_dir data/external/plantvillage \
#   --output_path artifacts/checkpoints/pretrained/mobilenet_v2-plantvillage.ckpt

# %% [markdown] id="8edb47106e1a46a883d545849b8ab81b"
# ### Level 3 Checkpoint
#
# `ImageNet (pre-trained) -> PlantVillage (fine-tuning) -> PlantDoc (fine-tuning)`
#
# Note the `--base_weights` argument. We are effectively resuming from the level 2 checkpoint.
#
# Like level 2, we will not freeze any parameters and we will discard the classifier head, replacing it with a new one with the number of neurons equal to the number of classes for the PlantDoc dataset (27).

# %% id="69798b96"
# !uv run python src/jute_disease/engines/dl/pretrain.py \
#   --data_dir data/external/plantdoc \
#   --base_weights artifacts/checkpoints/pretrained/mobilenet_v2-plantvillage.ckpt \
#   --output_path artifacts/checkpoints/pretrained/mobilenet_v2-plantvillage-plantdoc.ckpt

# %% [markdown] id="a1cf8c02"
# Now that we have level 2 and level 3 checkpoints, we can proceed with the grid search.

# %% id="32809cc5"
# !uv run python scripts/run_grid_search.py configs/grid/mobilenet_v2_grid.yaml

# ## Extras

# %% [markdown]
# If you inspect the codebase, you will notice that the image preprocessing pipeline includes cropping the images to 256x256 pixels. We got curious and trained a level 1 MobileNet V2 with dropout rates 0.0 and 0.1 but with images cropped to 512x512 pixels. We wanted to compare their performance to their 256x256 counterparts.

# %%
# !uv run python scripts/train_dl_512.py

# %% [markdown]
# We obtained the ff. results:

# Stuff to add

# - analysis
#   - conclusion that 512x512 may actually be worse, but we still need statistical validation
