# # Deep Learning Model Selection and Training
#
# `(update)`
# In this notebook, we will focus exclusively on Phase 1 testing and selection for Deep Learning:
# - Validate heavy Deep Learning Baselines (Inception V3, VGG16, DenseNet201).
# - Perform a grid search across Transfer Learning Initialization Strategies for MobileViT.
# - Execute runs using the unified Lightning `train_dl.py` scripts and `run_grid_search.py`.

# ## Transfer Learning Setup
#
# We saw from EDA that our dataset is pretty small (2382 images across 6 classes) for an image recognition task. To address our limitation in data, we decided to employ transfer learning as a key technique (among others, such as data augmentation) for our deep learning experiments.
#
# (levels of transfer learning)
# 1. **Level 1**: ImageNet -> our Jute dataset
# 2. **Level 2**: ImageNet -> PlantVillage -> our Jute dataset
# 3. **Level 3**: ImageNet -> PlantVillage -> PlantDoc -> our Jute dataset
#
# Levels 2 and 3 are known as **multistage transfer learning (MSTL)**, which as the name suggests, is transfer learning with multiple stages. An analogy of TL vs. MSTL can be made in the task of teaching a Tagalog-speaking Filipino the Spanish language. While we could just teach them Spanish directly (TL), it may be more effective to first teach them Chavacano (a Spanish-based language spoken in the Philippines) before teaching them Spanish (MSTL). Perhaps learning Chavacano first will make learning Spanish a lot easier, leading to a greater Spanish proficiency by the end.
#
# Thus, we hope that transfer learning will enable our deep learning models to adapt general patterns learned from ImageNet objects to the domain of leaf disease detection. We are also curious as to whether utilizing MSTL with similar but general datasets such as PlantVillage and PlantDoc can improve performance.
#
# Specifically, we will experiment with six (6) established deep learning architectures:
# - InceptionV3
# - VGG16
# - DenseNet201
# - ResNet
# - MobileNet
# - MobileViT
#
# `(i will polish later)`

# %% [markdown]
# ## Deep Learning Baselines (Level 1: ImageNet Only)
#
# We systematically train and evaluate our six chosen architectures on the `DATA_ZIP_PATH` jute splits. Every model's feature extractor initiates from ImageNet generic representations. We will freeze their backbones and only train the final custom dense classifiers.

# %% [markdown]
# **Fast Dev Run Validation**
#
# First, we dispatch a rapid sanity check using PyTorch Lightning's `fast_dev_run` capability. This performs exactly 1 training and validation batch traversing through all 6 architectures. It mathematically verifies gradients flow properly without silently crashing an hour later!

# %%
# !uv run python scripts/train_all_dl_check.py

# %% [markdown]
# **Execute 6 Deep Learning Baselines**
#
# Running the master sequential launcher. This autonomously `fits` and subsequently `tests` each `.yaml` model config entirely using your GPU.

# %%
# !uv run python scripts/train_all_dl.py

# %% [markdown]
# ## === Everything above is final ===


# %% [markdown]
# ## 2. MSTL Domain Initializations (Pre-training)
# We now download the massive `PlantVillage` and specialized `PlantDoc` datasets via KaggleHub to execute the Multi-Stage Transfer Learning on our MobileViT engine.

# %%
from jute_disease.data.download import download_plant_doc, download_plant_village

# Download external datasets directly into Colab environment
download_plant_village()
download_plant_doc()

# %% [markdown]
# **Pre-Train MobileViT on PlantVillage (Produces Level 2 Checkpoint)**
# We use our custom PyTorch Lightning pre-training script on PlantVillage. Early-stopping is implemented intrinsically (Defaults to 50 epochs, halts upon val_loss convergence).

# %%
# !uv run python src/jute_disease/engines/dl/pretrain.py \
#   --data_dir data/external/plantvillage \
#   --output_path artifacts/checkpoints/pretrained/mobilevit_plantvillage.ckpt

# %% [markdown]
# **Pre-Train MobileViT on PlantDoc (Produces Level 3 Checkpoint)**
# Note the `--base_weights` parameter: We resume *exactly* from the Level 2 checkpoint! This synthesizes the entire ImageNet -> PlantVillage -> PlantDoc hierarchy!

# %%
# !uv run python src/jute_disease/engines/dl/pretrain.py \
#   --data_dir data/external/plantdoc \
#   --base_weights artifacts/checkpoints/pretrained/mobilevit_plantvillage.ckpt \
#   --output_path artifacts/checkpoints/pretrained/mobilevit_plantvillage_plantdoc.ckpt

# %% [markdown]
# ## 3. Transfer Learning Grid Search (MobileViT Evaluation)
# Running our Grid Search config utilizing the newly synthesized checkpoints for MobileViT, quantifying the precise benefits of each Initialization Level on small-dataset Leaf Disease recognition!

# %%
# !uv run python scripts/run_grid_search.py configs/grid/mobilevit_grid.yaml

# %% [markdown]
# ## 4. WandB Analysis
# From Weights & Biases, we can now deduce our Champion architectural baseline, as well as definitively prove whether or not Level 3 MSTL was superior computationally versus Level 1 generic pretraining.
