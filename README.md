## 3. Running the Project

### 3.1. Prerequisites

To reproduce our results, you will need the following installed:

1. **Git:** Used to clone this repository.

2. **Python:** We require Python `>=3.11` for this project. You do not need to install the specific version as it will be installed by `uv`.

3. **uv:** The package manager we used. Installation instructions can be found at <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>.

### 3.2. CLI Entry Points

This project provides unified CLI entry points for common tasks:

- **`scripts/train_dl.py`**: Entry point for the Deep Learning engine (Lightning CLI).

  ```bash
  uv run python scripts/train_dl.py fit --config configs/baselines/mobilenet_v2.yaml
  ```

- **`make train-ml`**: Entry point for the Machine Learning engine sweep. Or run manually via `uv run python scripts/train_ml.py`.

  ```bash
  uv run python scripts/train_ml.py --classifier rf --feature_type crafted
  ```

- **`make train-dl-512`**: Specialized target to execute a high-resolution (512x512) experiment track, including test evaluation and automated metrics aggregation.

- **`make grid-search`**: Executes Phase 1 (Transfer Learning / Dropout) grid searches. (Append `-check` for a fast dev-run).

- **`scripts/aggregate_results.py`**: Utility to consolidate metrics from multiple CSVLogger outputs into a single analysis-ready CSV.

### 3.3. Reproducing the Results

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qu1r0ra/jute-disease-detection
   ```

2. Navigate to the project root and install all dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd jute-disease-detection
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run through the Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/reproducibility/` in numerical order:
   1. `01_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`
   2. `02_Model_Selection_Training_DL.ipynb`
   3. `02_Model_Selection_Training_ML.ipynb`
   4. ...

   _Notes_
   - When running a notebook, select `.venv` in root as the kernel.
   - More instructions can be found in each notebook.
