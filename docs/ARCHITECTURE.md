## Core Design Principles

### 1. Unified Public API

Each subpackage in `src/jute_disease/` (e.g., `models.ml`, `data`, `utils`) uses `__init__.py` to expose a clean, flattened public API.

- **Internal developers** use relative imports where appropriate or `from jute_disease.x import y` to avoid circular dependencies.
- **External consumers** (scripts, tests, notebooks) use the clean package-level imports (e.g., `from jute_disease.models.ml import RandomForest`).

### 2. Command Line Interface (CLI)

The project exposes unified CLI entry points defined in `pyproject.toml`:

- **`scripts/train_dl.py`**: The main entry point for the Deep learning engine. It leverages the **Lightning CLI** to drive training, testing, and prediction from configuration files.
- **`make train-ml`**: Centralized Makefile entry point for Classical ML training, executing Python functions housed in `scripts/train_ml.py` and `src/jute_disease/engines/ml/`.

### 3. Deep Learning Service (Lightning + Timm)

The DL pipeline is built using **PyTorch Lightning** for state-of-the-art reproducibility and boilerplate reduction.

- **LightningModule (`Classifier`)**: The core class handling the training loop, optimization, logging, and metrics.
- **Backbone System**: Uses a generic `TimmBackbone` to wrap any model from the `timm` library, allowing for easy experimentation with different architectures (e.g., MobileNetV2, ResNet-50, Inception v3, EfficientNet-B5, EfficientNet-B7). Supporting global/local input resolution via the `--data.image_size` parameter.
- **Lightning CLI**: Training is driven by configuration files in `configs/`, promoting "Configuration as Code".

### 4. Machine Learning Framework (Scikit-learn Adapters)

Classical ML models are integrated using a custom adapter pattern to unify them with the DL workflow.

- **Feature Extractors**: Classes like `CraftedFeatureExtractor` convert raw images into numerical vectors (HSV, LBP, HOG). `RawPixelFeatureExtractor` handles pixel flattening.
- **Adapters**: The `SklearnClassifier` base class wraps standard scikit-learn estimators to provide a consistent `fit`/`predict`/`save`/`load` interface across the project.
- **Implementations**: Currently supports Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, and Gaussian Naive Bayes.

### 5. Data Management & Reproducibility

- **DataModule**:
  - Handles dataset splitting (Train/Val/Test) with fixed seeds.
  - Supports **K-Fold Cross-Validation** via `set_fold()`.
  - Implements **Weighted Random Sampling** to handle class imbalance.
- **Transforms**: Uses a factory pattern (`create_pipeline`) via **Albumentations** for robust and deterministic data augmentation. Supports both global/fixed preprocessing for ML and resolution-parameterized preprocessing for DL.
- **Seed Everything**: A centralized `seed_everything` utility ensures deterministic behavior across Python, Numpy, specific libraries, and PyTorch.

### 6. Unified Diagnostics & Metrics

Both pipelines are evaluated identically using a combined **Experiment Aggregation Utility** (`scripts/aggregate_results.py`). We completely deprecated `scikit-learn` metrics in favor of native PyTorch `torchmetrics.MetricCollection`.

- **EVAL_METRICS**: Computes Accuracy, Macro-F1, Precision, and Recall uniformly for both classical and neural models.
- **Aggregation**: Metrics from `WandbLogger` (cloud) and `CSVLogger` (local) are automatically synthesized into tabular CSV files for all Grid Searches and manual experiment targets.

### 7. Code Quality & Standards

- **Type Safety**: The codebase adheres to strict type checking using modern Python 3.10+ syntax (e.g., `list[str] | None`).
- **Formatting**: Code is formatted and linted using `ruff` to ensure PEP 8 compliance.
- **CLI Patterns**: Scripts follow the "Raise in Logic, Exit in Main" pattern to allow for programmatic re-use and unit testing of automation functions.
- **Testing**: A comprehensive test suite (`tests/`) covers unit tests (logic verification) and slower integration tests (end-to-end pipeline).

## Tools & Dependencies

- **uv**: Package management and environment isolation.
- **PyTorch Lightning**: Deep learning framework.
- **timm**: Pretrained computer vision models.
- **Scikit-learn**: Classical machine learning algorithms.
- **Albumentations**: Fast image augmentation library.
- **WandB**: Experiment tracking and visualization.
